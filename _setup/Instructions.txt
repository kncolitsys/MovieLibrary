3. Create a sql user and grant it "dbowner" permissions to the "MoiveLibrary" database
4. Setup a datasource in the CF Administrator to point to the newly created database.
5. Edit the "ColdSpring.xml" file under the config directory:
	- in the "reactorConfiguration" bean
		- change the "pathToConfigXml" to match the path to "Reactor.xml" to your path defined in step 1
		- change the "project" name if disired
		- change the "dsn" to the datasource you created in step 4
		- change the "mapping" to match the application path to your path defined in step 1
6. Edit "Application.cfc" if desired to change the application settings such as "adminEmail"
